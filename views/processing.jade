      h4 bezier.pde
      p This is a short and sweet project to create a dynamic audio visualizer that. The apparent sine wave is made up of 2 bezier curves and will change position based on the location of your mouse. You can drag the screen to edit the waves themselves and click the screen for audio that changes if the mouse is dragged. Clicking the plane with the project will start/stop the music.

      h4 disco.pde
      p A disco styled audio visualizer that's without user input. The project relied on a no longer maintained processing library called maxim.js so I'm currently looking for a way to make the same project using the web audio API instead of processing because features without the API are too limited for it.
