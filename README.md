To self: Don't forget to concatenate your css files!!

If you're looking for the Processing projects on the site, they're under /public/javascripts

##TODO:
* Better code snips
* Better README (haha)
* create mayan numerical project/post (If I'm bored)
* Fix spelling errors (base bones in the processing one... Come on)
* Add processing.js projects/post
  * This requires a new audio solution as Maxim.js appears to be deprecated
